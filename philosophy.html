            scale. There‚Äôs a lot of fluff and snake oil out there on ways teams
            can be more effective. We‚Äôve found these lessons are repeatedly the

          ran right into the SaaS-plosion we‚Äôre living in today. The rise of
          task management masquerading as project management really did a number
          on ‚ÄúResponding to Change over Following a Plan.‚Äù And then came the
          frameworks. If you ask Google, there are more than 50 known Agile
          Frameworks (SCRUM, KanBan, etc.), not to mention the new scaling
          frameworks (SAFe, Scrum@Scale etc). We think it's high time to get
          back to first principles ‚Äì and that is what we advocate for here in
          our anti-framework for Getting $#*! Done at Scale.

        </h2>
        <p class="text-[18px] tracking-tight py-4 text-justify">
          If we put the frameworks, goal methodologies, and task management
          tools aside ‚Äì what are we left with? At the core, we do projects. And
          they‚Äôre done by a team of people. We have found that stripping away
          the jargon and process, and focusing on getting really good at the
          fundamentals, goes a long way toward improving productivity. In this
          case, that means helping people get really good at executing projects.
          In fact, that‚Äôs why we named our first product KATA. Japanese for
          ‚Äúform,‚Äù KATA is commonly used in martial arts to refer to practicing
          fundamentals to achieve overall mastery. üëå

              Moving fast means not wasting effort, which allows for more shots
              on goal. Moving fast at scale means ensuring large groups of
              people are spending their effort on the highest value items ‚Äì to
              do work that matters ‚Äì in concert with one another, in complex
              systems. You don‚Äôt just need raw speed. You need velocity: speed
              AND direction. Otherwise you run the risk of going really quickly
              in the wrong direction(s) and ending up in the wrong place. This
              is where projects come in.

              </h2>
              <p class="text-[18px] tracking-tight py-4 text-justify">
                Chess is a beautiful game of decision making and strategy, but
                it‚Äôs also one of clear rules and complete information. You can
                see the entire board all of the time. If you are a skilled
                player, there is little betting in chess. Victory and skill are
                closely correlated.

                As nice as that might sound, real life is never that
                straightforward. As Annie Duke states in her popular book,
                <a href="" class="text-[17px] text-red-500 text-justify">
                  Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don't Have

                </a>
              </p>

              <p class="text-[18px] tracking-tight py-4 text-justify">
                , ‚ÄúChess, for all its strategic complexity, isn‚Äôt a great model
                for decision-making in life, where most of our decisions involve
                hidden information and a much greater influence of luck.‚Äù
              </p>
              <p class="text-[18px] tracking-tight py-4 text-justify">
                Environments shift, information is incomplete, and there is no
                perfect way to play. Every decision becomes a bet. And projects
                are the bets organizations make. How we decide to apply our
                finite resources and people.
              </p>
              <p class="text-[18px] tracking-tight py-4 text-justify">
                When reframed as bets, you suddenly realize that projects can‚Äôt
                be approached as a fixed set of things to do, aka tasks, to
                achieve a known outcome. This is especially true in the case of
                software development. Instead, projects should be viewed as
                establishing a bet on a desired outcome, with recognition that
                you are in an ever-changing environment with incomplete
                information. Acknowledging this upfront lets the team see
                shortcuts and optimizations they‚Äôd otherwise miss in blind
                pursuit of task completion.

              <p class="text-[18px] tracking-tight py-4 text-justify">
                The popularity of task management tools makes it easy to mistake
                speed for velocity. Look at all these tickets we are closing!
                But are we moving the needle on our business objectives? Are we
                having an impact for our customers?
              </p>
              <p class="text-[18px] tracking-tight py-4 text-justify">
                Focusing a project on achieving an outcome, rather than getting
                a bunch of tasks done, eliminates wasted effort. It gives your
                team the guidance, and the autonomy, they need to decide if a
                task is actually worth doing.
              </p>
              <p class="text-[18px] tracking-tight py-4 text-justify">
                When you focus on achieving an outcome, rather than meeting a
                (often poorly estimated) ship date, and pair it with thinking in
                bets, you are in a better position to assess tradeoffs and
                potential return on effort, or ROE. You can then match your
                appetite for investment with the potential outcomes, and place
                your bets (aka projects) accordingly.
              </p>
              <p class="text-[18px] tracking-tight py-4 text-justify">
                This is powerful. Not only will you save wasted effort and find
                shortcuts along your way, but it lets you say ‚Äúno‚Äù to more
                projects upfront, avoiding even more wasted effort!

              It's a subtle but important mental shift. ROI is a financial term.
              But more often than not, we aren‚Äôt making financial investments
              with projects. Instead, we‚Äôre allocating people‚Äôs time and energy,
              which means we‚Äôre investing effort. So, Return on Effort. Why does
              this distinction matter? Well, the math is different. Sure, time
              is money and all that. But people are not resources. When you
              invest $100 and want to double your investment you invest $100
              more. Asking people to work twice as hard yields variable results.
              You may get more or less than twice the effort depending on how
              you ask! And doubling the people, well, projects
              <a href="" class="text-[17px] text-red-500 text-justify">
                don't work like that
              </a>
              . If you remember that we are making investment decisions not with
              algebra, but multivariable calculus, it will go a long way into
              better upfront decision making and appetite assessment.

              But we all recognize that projects evolve as they go. As we make
              progress, we gain new information, which alters our course. We
              rarely know the entire path forward when we start. But, we do know
              the concrete next step, or milestone, we are working towards.
              These milestones pull us closer to achieving our overall
              objectives.

              Tracking milestones keeps Parkinson‚Äôs Law at bay by tracking
              smaller, higher confidence, interim goals. This lets you subdivide
              the entropy for lower overall project risk, and have small
              victories that build confidence and momentum.

              The best way to write and set milestones is in the language of
              your project‚Äôs end users and what is being achieved or delivered.
              Not in task management terms ‚ÄúTax Engine V2‚Äù but in project ones
              ‚ÄúBegin checkout completion rate test with new tax engine‚Äù. For
              product development, use product functionality language. For
              technical projects, use technical deliverables. This makes it
              simple for everyone to connect the goals of the project to the
              progress being made. For example, stating when a new feature will
              be complete or a target country launched, is more helpful than
              knowing that the ‚Äúback-end is complete.‚Äù

              Status updates should then cover progress towards achieving both

          It‚Äôs easy to fall into the myopic ‚Äúit‚Äôll be done when it‚Äôs done‚Äù
          mentality, especially as an Engineer. While that sentiment certainly
          carries some weight, other folks need to be in the know so they can
          successfully complete their own projects. Marketing needs to be ready
          to tell the customer. Customer Ops needs to be prepared to support the
          customer. And Sales needs to be equipped to sell the thing you're
          building. Setting milestones with target dates that are visible to the
          entire organization is a great way to keep dependent teams informed.
          Perhaps even more importantly, it builds trust, and increases the odds
          of your overall project success. Consider this ‚Äì if users are never
          told about a new feature, or a new capability is never sold,

              Sprint processes are a great example of this. Some teams prefer
              two-week cycles, others six. Some projects have fixed shipping
              schedules, such as app store updates, and some are arbitrary
              dates. Sprints are great at scheduling and coordinating tasks and
              should be flexible to match the actual work the team is doing. But
              sprints tell you little about progress. You need to standardize

                special (and hard!) is its improvisational format, or artistic
                autonomy. jazz artists riff and jam in real time. This works
                because in addition to their strong functional skills, each
                musician knows how to communicate (through active listening)

                The entire project team should be responsible for achieving a
                successful project outcome. But each project should have a
                single-threaded owner responsible for its successful execution.
                Projects develop their own gravity, and someone needs to hold
                the world in their head to keep it moving along. It‚Äôs difficult
                to do that when you‚Äôre spread across multiple worlds!

              <p class="text-[18px] tracking-tight py-4 text-justify">
                For the rest of the project team, it‚Äôs impractical to only ever
                work on one project at a time. However, the number of
                simultaneous projects should be limited to as few as possible.
                This keeps things from falling through the cracks, and it lets
                the momentum of a project build on itself.

              Leverage project phases to help you think about how team members
              should be staffed against projects. Team members should never be
              working on multiple projects in the Execute phase at the same
              time. For projects of any substance, this is simply too much to
              tackle at once and puts both projects at risk. However, it‚Äôs
              realistic to work on a project in the Propose phase while you are
              also actively working on a project in the Execute phase.

                Bad news should never be punished. If a warning flag is raised,
                this is instead an opportunity to jump in and help (if needed).
                Wouldn‚Äôt you rather know immediately when a project is going
                sideways so that the broader team can put their heads together
                to get it back on track? The alternative is so much worse.

                Normalize the fact that not every project is green all the time.
                A centralized project directory helps to drive awareness and
                acceptance of this.

                Carving out time to look back and reflect is a strong tool for
                continuous improvement. However, we have found much greater
                value in reflection at the project level, rather than after each
                sprint. Sprints simply aren‚Äôt long enough to make meaningful
                observations beyond micro-complaints. And reviewing a sprint is
                just reviewing our ability to get work done in a specified time
                period. We miss the bigger picture observations as to whether we
                were able to problem solve, work cross-functionally, and achieve
                an outcome in the quickest time possible. There‚Äôs much more
                continuous improvement fruit to pick in the latter.
